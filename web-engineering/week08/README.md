# Get Started with React

In this project we will just explore multiple aspects of React. For that this project is setup in the following way:

1) Firstly, It uses `vite` to setup a react project from scratch as demonstrated in [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch#vite)

2) Secondly, it follows the [Quick Start Guide](https://react.dev/learn) in React Docs to create multiple components that demonstrate the React Concepts.

3) Thirdly, the main App.jsx imports and calls all componenets. You can comment/uncomment the required components to explore the respective components and play with it.

4) Comment/un-comment commponents in [App.jsx](./project_3.0/src/App.jsx) to see the respective component
