### Note (This is optional learning at this stage):
For the project, we have used Airtable as backend APIs. If you want to use your own Airtable's database, then you need to:
- Sign Up on Airtable
- Create a new base for portfolio
- Create tables for Projects (columns: Titles(single line text), Description (long text), Image (attachment type), tags (multiselect)) and Skills (columns: Name(single line text), icon(single line text))
- Create a new API token from [Airtable's Builderhub](https://airtable.com/create/tokens)
- Update the URL and the token based on your respective tables and tokens

Then you need to repeate the same process for contact us section
