In The Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful

# Web Engineering Course Notes

By will of Allah, This Web Engineering course notes are being published by [Jawad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jawadcheema/). These notes are based on his experience of teaching Web Engineering course to Students of BS (Software Engineering) degree program at [CFD Campus, FAST-NU](https://cfd.nu.edu.pk/).

## About the course
If Allah wills, The goal of the course is to help students
- Learn the basics of web development
- Develop ability to architecture a resonabily optimized web solutions
- Apply that knowledge to solve real problems

## Pre-Requisites

If Allah wills, The complexity and pace of this course will be suitable for students that have understanding of following concepts:
- Advanced programming knowledge in any language
- Basic understanding of Software Engineering principles and methodolgies
- Some familiarity with web technologies and related concepts like web, web applications, html, css, web apis

Though, depending on your learning habits, you can simply start the course and explore the missing parts as you face any challenge

## Teaching Methodology

If Allah wills, we plan to apply following pratcies to make the learnign experience worth while:

- Project-based: Focus on building projects in the class while targeting some hypothetical problem
- Iterative and Incremental: We will learn multiple aspects of web development in parallel while adding more complexity and advance concepts in subsequent projects
- Flipped Classroom: Provide sufficient guidliens to learn the next topic on their own before the lecture. So that we can be more hands-on during the lecture
- Self learning: The assignments and course projects are more challenging than the content covered. This is to help students push their limits, learn on their own, and go beyond what we can teach.

## Honesty is the best policy

Honestly speaking, all the above is our wishful thinking. And we are trying to achieve the above, and optimize even further. May Allah help us push towards this goal to the best of our abilities.
